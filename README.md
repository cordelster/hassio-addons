All of these add-ons I developed for my own personal use, and most have been my private collection for some time and I regularly maintain them.

My primary focus is security first, followed by tenacity for quality, and recently consolidation of powered devices in my homelab brought me to making these addons.

I can always use help with documentation as I tend to over do it. If you wish to add to this repo I'm open to collaboration and keeping projects alive.

### A couple other great repos to check out:
[alexbelgium](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons)
[einschmidt](https://github.com/einschmidt/hassio-addons) Your packages inspired me to let my addons in the wild. Get ready.
 
 #### If any of these add-ons saves you time or makes your setup easier, I would be extremely grateful for your support!
